                    <p>I've been coding this app for 83 years now, and it's still not working. I'm in the hospital, literally on my deathbed. I've lived for 100 years, and I still can't die with peace of mind because this stupid app WON'T WORK. WHY DOESN'T IT WORK? I really don't understand. At this point, I don't even remember what the app was supposed to do. Haha. And it's my life's work. Ah, well. I guess that's life.</p>

                    <h1>Easy Peasy App</h1>
                    <p>Wow, that was the easiest app to code! And I just learned to code. I've only been out of the womb for like six weeks, but when I heard that my late, great grandfather wasn't able to finish his life's work before he passed, I thought that was kind of sad. So I found the code for the app he was working on and his notebook that explained its purpose. Then, I coded his app over the weekend. His code was all gibberish, so I had to delete it, but now his life's work is complete. He still wasn't able to die with peace of mind, but at least I had a fun little while my mommy fed me applesauce.</p>
